# CCTV-People-Tracker
This project demonstrates human detection and tracking using OpenCV and Tkinter. The user can select between a webcam and a video file as the source. The application uses a HOG descriptor for human detection and the CSRT tracker for tracking. It's a simple and effective way to explore computer vision techniques.
